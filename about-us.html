            </div>
            <p class="page-text">Acadia Park Equipment Co. was founded by a brother and sister who were inspired by their love of the outdoors. They decided to start Acadia Outdoor Equipment Co. in response to all of the overpriced outdoor products in the big box retail stores, and sought to create high-quality products at a price anyone can afford. The companyâ€™s mission is to spread the love and appreciation of the outdoors to all of its customers and beyond.</p>
            <div class="header-text">
                <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="page-text">As Acadia Park Equipment Co. moves towards its goal of making it affordable for outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy nature, we will support organizations whose main efforts involve research to continue preservation efforts towards the environment. We regularly encourage employees to engage in preservation and clean-up efforts to help the environment.</p>
